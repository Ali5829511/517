## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask 3.0.0, Python 3.11+
- **Database:** SQLite3 with `housing_database.db`
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI API (GPT-4 Vision), EasyOCR, Tesseract, OpenCV
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (static files in `/static/`)
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login with bcrypt
- **Deployment:** Gunicorn, Railway/Render compatible

## Architecture & File Structure

### Core Application Files
- `app.py` - Main Flask application with routes and AI integration
- `database_api.py` - Database access layer with SQLite operations
- `config.py` - Configuration management (Development, Testing, Production)
- `generate_database.py` - Database initialization and seeding
- `generate_reports.py` - Report generation utilities

### Static Assets
- `/static/` - HTML pages, CSS, images (30+ HTML files)
- `/uploads/` - User-uploaded images
- `/processed_images/` - AI-processed vehicle plate images

### Testing & Development
- `test_app.py` - Basic Flask application tests
- `test_development_setup.py` - Development environment validation tests
- `Makefile` - Development commands (install, test, lint, build, etc.)
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

### Python Style
- **Follow PEP 8** with 100 character line limit
- Use **Black** for automatic formatting: `make format`
- Use **Flake8** for linting: `make lint`
- Type hints are encouraged but not strictly enforced

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: `CamelCase`
- Functions/variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Arabic Language Support
- This application has **extensive Arabic language support**
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all files with Arabic text
- Database tables include Arabic field names and values
- HTML files contain Arabic RTL (right-to-left) content
- Comments may be in Arabic or English - maintain consistency within files
- When adding new features, provide Arabic translations for user-facing text

### Documentation
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Include both Arabic and English descriptions when relevant
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Example:
```python
def get_all_residents():
    """
    الحصول على جميع السكان
    Get all residents from the database
    
    Returns:
        list: List of resident dictionaries with details
    """
```

## Development Workflow

### Setup Commands
```bash
make install          # Install dependencies
make install-dev      # Install dev dependencies (pytest, black, flake8)
make dev             # Run development server
make test            # Run tests
make lint            # Check code quality
make build           # Build for production
```

### Before Committing
1. Run `make test` to ensure tests pass
2. Run `make lint` to check code quality
3. Format code with `make format` if needed
4. Ensure no sensitive data (API keys) in commits

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality in `test_app.py` or new `test_*.py` files
- Use pytest fixtures for shared setup
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, focus on critical paths
- Run `make test-cov` to check coverage

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- `residents` - Faculty member information
- `buildings` - Building details
- `units` - Residential units (linked to buildings)
- `vehicle_stickers` - Vehicle registration and plates
- `parking_spots` - Parking space management
- `processed_images` - AI-processed vehicle images with metadata

### Database Operations
- Use `database_api.py` functions for all database access
- Foreign key constraints are enabled: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
- All functions return dictionaries or lists of dictionaries
- Connection handling is managed in `get_db_connection()`

## OpenAI Integration

### Configuration
- API key stored in environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Client initialization with fallback handling in `app.py`
- `OPENAI_AVAILABLE` flag indicates API availability

### Usage Patterns
```python
if OPENAI_AVAILABLE and client:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[...]
    )
```

### Vision API for Plate Recognition
- Used for license plate detection and OCR
- Base64 image encoding for API submission
- Fallback to EasyOCR/Tesseract if OpenAI unavailable
- Results stored in `processed_images` table

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Flask-Login for session management
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Session cookies: HttpOnly, SameSite protection
- CSRF protection via Flask-WTF

### API Keys & Secrets
- **NEVER commit API keys or secrets**
- Use `.env` file for local development (in `.gitignore`)
- Use environment variables in production
- Check `.env.example` for required variables

### Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use `secure_filename()` for file uploads
- Parameterized SQL queries (avoid SQL injection)
- File type validation for uploads (images only)

## Common Tasks & Patterns

### Adding a New Route
```python
@app.route('/api/new_endpoint')
def new_endpoint():
    """Brief description of endpoint"""
    try:
        # Implementation
        return jsonify({'success': True, 'data': result})
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in new_endpoint: {e}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

### Database Query Pattern
```python
def get_something():
    """Get something from database"""
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition = ?', (value,))
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return [dict(row) for row in rows]
```

### Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks for external operations (DB, API, file I/O)
- Log errors with `logger.error()` for debugging
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Include Arabic error messages for user-facing errors

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- `FLASK_ENV=development`
- `FLASK_DEBUG=1`
- Auto-reload enabled
- Detailed error pages

### Production
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `DEBUG=False`
- Use Gunicorn: `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4`
- HTTPS required (SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True)

### Required Environment Variables
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # OpenAI API key
SECRET_KEY=...                   # Flask secret key
DATABASE_PATH=housing_database.db
FLASK_ENV=development|production
```

## Deployment

### Supported Platforms

- AI processing is async-friendly but currently synchronous
- Static file caching disabled in development, enabled in production

## Maintenance & Operations

### Database Backup
```bash
make db-backup  # Creates timestamped backup
```

### Logs
- Configured in `config.py` (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FILE)
- Production logs to `logs/app.log`
- Use `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`

### Monitoring
- Check `/api/statistics` for system health
- Database record counts
- OpenAI API availability status
